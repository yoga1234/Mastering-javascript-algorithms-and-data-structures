    <title>RegEx: match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities</title>

      /*
      * You learned how to match literal patterns (/literal/) and wildcard char (/./).
      * Those are the extremes of regular expressions,
      * There one finds exact matches and the other matches everything.
      * There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.
      *
      * You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes.
      * Character classes allow you to define a group of a characters you wish to -
      * match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.
      *
      * For example, you want to match "bag", "big" and "bug" but not "bog".
      * You can create regex [/b[aiu]g/] to do this.
      * The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters "a", "i", or "u".
      */

      // Example
      function example(){
        let bigStr = "big";
        let bagStr = "bag";
        let bugStr = "bug";
        let bogStr = "bog";
        let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;

        bigStr.match(bgRegex); // returns ["big"]
        bagStr.match(bgRegex); // returns ["bag"]
        bugStr.match(bgRegex); // returns ["bug"]
        bogStr.match(bgRegex); // returns null
      }

      // example 2
      function example2(){
        let quoteSample = "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.";
        let vowelRegex = /aeiou/gi; // return all in array and case sensitive
        let result = vowelRegex;
