    <title>Regex: Match a Literal String with different Possibilities</title>

    /*
    * Using regexes like /coding/, you can look for the pattern "coding" in another string.
    * This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern.
    * You can search for multiple pattern using [alternation] or [OR] operator: |.
    *
    * This operator matches patterns either before or after it.
    * For example, if you wanted to match "yes" or "no",
    * the regex you want is [/yes|no/].
    *
    * You can also search for more than just two patterns.
    * You can do this by adding more patterns with more OR operators separating them,
    * like [/yes|no|maybe/].

    // example function
    function animal(){
      let petString = "King has a pet cat";
      let petRegex = "/dog|cat|bird|fish"; // dog or cat or bird or fish
      let result = petRegex.test(petString); // Will return true
    }
