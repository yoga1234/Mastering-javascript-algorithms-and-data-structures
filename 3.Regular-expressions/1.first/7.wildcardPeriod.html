    <title>RegEx: Match Anything with Wildcard Period</title>

      /*
      * Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns.
      * Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time.
      * Luckily you can save time using the wildcard character: [.]
      *
      * The wildcard character [.] will match any one character.
      * The wildcard is also called [dot] and [period].
      * You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex.
      * For example, if you wanted to match "hug", "huh", "hut" and "hum",
      * you can use the regex [/hu./] to match all four words.

      // Example function
      function(){
        let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
        let hugStr = "Bear hug";
        let huRegex = /hu./;
        huRegex.test(humStr); // Returns true
        huRegex.test(hugStr); // Returns true
      }
