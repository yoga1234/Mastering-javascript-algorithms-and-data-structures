    <title>RegEx: Ignore Case while Matching</title>

      /*
      * Up until now, you've looked at regexes to do literal matches of strings.
      * But sometimes, you might want to also match case differences.
      *
      * Case (or sometimes letter case) is the difference between uppercase letters and lowercase letters.
      * Example of uppercase are "A", "B", and "C".
      * Example of lowercase are "a", "b", and "c";
      *
      * You can match both cases using what is called flag.
      * There are no other flags but here you'll focus on the flag that ignores case-
      * the [i] flag.
      * You can use it by appending it into the regex.
      * An example of using this flag is [/ignorecase/i].
      * This regex can match the strings "ignorecase", iGnorECase", and "IgnoreCase".
      */

      // Example
      function matchString(){
        let myString = "freecodecamp";
        let fccRegex = /FreeCodeCamp/i;
        let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
      }
