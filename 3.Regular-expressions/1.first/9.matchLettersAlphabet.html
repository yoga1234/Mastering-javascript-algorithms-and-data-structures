      /*
      * You saw how you can use character sets to specify a group of char to match,
      * But that's a lot of typing when you need to match a large range of characters
      * (for example, every letter in alphabet).
      * Fortunately, there is a built-in feature that makes this short and simple.
      *
      * Inside a character set,
      * you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: -.
      *
      * For example, to match lowercase letters [a] through [e] you would use [a-e].

      // Example
      function example(){

        let batStr = "bat";
        let matStr = "mat";
        let bgRegex = /[a-e]at/;

        catStr.match(bgRegex); // returns ["cat"]
        batStr.match(bgRegex); // returns ["bat"]
        matStr.match(bgRegex); // returns null
