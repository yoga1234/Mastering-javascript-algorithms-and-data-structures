    /*
    * Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings.
    * You create patterns to help you do that matching.
    *
    * I you want to find the word "the" in the string "The dog chased the cat",
    * you could use the following regular expression: /the/.
    * Notice that the quote marks are not required within the regular expression.
    *
    * Javascript has multiple ways to use regexes.
    * One way to test a regex is using the [.test()] method.
    * The [.test()] method takes the regex, applies it to string (which is placed inside the parentheses),
    * and returns [true] or [false] if your pattern finds something or not.

      let testRegex = /String/;
