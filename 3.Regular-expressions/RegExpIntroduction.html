    * Regular expression are special strings that represent a search pattern.
    * Also known as "regex".
    * They help programmers match, search and replace text.
    * Regular expression can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning.
    * The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want,
    * but only what you want.
