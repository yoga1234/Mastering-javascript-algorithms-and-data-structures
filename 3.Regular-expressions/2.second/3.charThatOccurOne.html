    <title>RegEx: Match Characters that Occur One or More Times</title>

      /*
      * Sometimes, you need to match a character (or group of char)
      * that appears one or more times in a row.
      * This means it occurs at least once, and may be repeated.
      *
      * You can use the + character to check if that is the case.
      * Remember, the char or pettern has to be present cosecutively.
      * That is, the character has to repeat one after the other.
      *
      * For example, [/a+/g] would find one match in "abc" and return ["a"].
      * Because of the +, it would also find a single match in "aabc" and return ["aa"].
      *
      * If it were instead checking the string "abab",
      * it would find two matches and return ["a", "a"] because [a] char aren't in a row.
      * There is a [b] between them.
      * Finally, since there is no "a" in the string "bcd", it wouldn't find a match.
