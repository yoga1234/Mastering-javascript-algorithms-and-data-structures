    <title>RegEx: Find Char with lazy matching</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <script>

    /*
    * In regular expressions, a greedy match finds the longest possible part of a string -
    * that fits the regex pattern and returns it as a match.
    * The alternative is called lazy match,
    * which finds the smalles possible part of the string that satisfies the regex pattern.
    *
    * You can apply the regex /t[a-z]*i to the string "titanic".
    * This regex is basically a pattern that starts with t ends with i,
    * and has some letters in between.
    *
    * Regular expressions are by default greedy,
    * so the match would return ["titani"].
    * It finds the largest sub-string possible to fit the pattern.
    *
    * However, you can use the ? char to change it to lazy matching.
    * "titanic" matches against the adjusted regex of /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].
    *
    * NOTE:
    * Parsing HTML with regular expressions should be avoided,
    * but pattern matching an HTML string with regular expressions is completely fine.
