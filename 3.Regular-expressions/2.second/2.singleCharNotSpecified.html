      /*
      * So far, you have created a set of character that you want to match,
      * but you could also create a set of a char that you do not want to match.
      * These types of char sets are called negated character sets.
      *
      * To create a negated character set,
      * you place char (^) after the opening bracket and before the char you do not want to match.
      *
      * For example, [/[^aeiou]/gi] matches all char that are not a vowel.
      * Note that char like [.], [!], [[], [@], [/] and whitespace are matched -
      * the negated vowel char set only excludes the vowel char.
      */

      // example
      function example(){
        let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
        let myRegex = /[^aeiou1-9]/gi;
        let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex);
        return result;
