    <title>Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays</title>

    /*
    * ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.
    *
    * One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring-
    * is that the spread opeartor unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list.
    * Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elemets you want to assign to variables.
    */

    // Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:
    const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    console.log(a, b);
    /*
    * The variable [a] is assigned the first value of the array,
    * and [b] is assigned the second value of the array.
    */

    /*
    * We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index.
    */
    const [q,w,,, e] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,];
    console.log(q, w, e); //1, 2, 5
