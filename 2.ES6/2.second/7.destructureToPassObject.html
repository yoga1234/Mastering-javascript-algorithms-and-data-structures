    /*
    * In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.
    */

    // Consider the code below:
    const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
      const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
      // Do something with these variable
    }

    // This effectively destructures the object sent into the function.
    // This can also be done in-place:
    const profileUpdate2 = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
      /*Do something with these fields */
    }
    // This removes some extra lines and makes our code look neat.

    /*
    * This has the added benefit of not having to manipulate an entire object in a function.
    * Only the fields that are needed are copied inside the function.
