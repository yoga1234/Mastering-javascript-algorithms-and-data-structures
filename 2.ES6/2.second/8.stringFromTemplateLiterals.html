    /*
    * A new features of ES6 is the template literal.
    * This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.
    *
    * Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and-
    * to use string interpolation features to create strings.
    */

    // Consider the code below:
    const person = {
      name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
      age: 56
    };
    // Template literal with multi-line and string interpolation
    const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
    I am ${person.age} years old.`;

    console.log(greeting); //prints
    // Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!
    // I am 56 years old.

    /*
    * A lot of things happened there.
    *
    * Firstly, the example uses backticks(`), bit quotes(' or ") to wrap the string.
    *
    * Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line,
    * both in the code and the output.
    * This saves inserting [\n] within strings.
    *
    * The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder.
    * Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore.
    * To add variables to strings,
    * you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with ${ and }.
    * Similarly, you can include the other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}.
    *
    * This new way of creating string gives more flexibility to create robust strings.
