    * ES6 adds some nice support for easily defining object literals.
    * Consider the following code:
    */

    const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
      x: x,
      y: y
    });
    /*
    * [getMousePosition] is a simple function that returns an object containing two fields.
    *
    * ES6 provides the syntatic sugar to eliminate the redudancy of having to write [x: x].
    * You can simply write [x] once,
    * it will be converted to [x: x] (or something equivalent) under the hood.
    */

    // Here is the same function from above rewritten to use this new syntax:
    const getMousePosition2 = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
