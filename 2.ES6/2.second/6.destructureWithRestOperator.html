    /*
    * In some situations involving array destructuring,
    * we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.
    * The result is similar to [Array.prototype.slice()].
    */

    // As shown below:
    const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
    console.log(a, b); // 1, 2
    console.log(arr); // [3, 4, 5, 7]

    /*
    * Variables [a] and [b] take the first and second values from the array.
    * After that, because of rest operator's presence,[arr] gets rest of the values in the form of an array.
    */

    /*
    * The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list.
    * As in, you cannot use the rest operator to catch a subarray that leaves out last element of the original array.
