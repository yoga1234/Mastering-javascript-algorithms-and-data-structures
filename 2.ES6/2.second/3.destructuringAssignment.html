    * Spread operator can effectively spread or unpack the contents of the array.
    *
    * We can do something similar with objects as well.
    * Destructuring assignmnemt is special syntax for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object to variables.

    // Considering the following ES5 Code:
    var voxel = {x: 3.6, y: 7.4, z: 6.54};
    var x = voxel.x;
    var y = voxel.y;
    var z = voxel.z;

    // Here's the same assignment statement with ES6 destructuring syntax:
    // const {x, y, z} = voxel; -> x = 3.6, y = 7.4, z = 6.45

    // If instead you want to store the values of voxel.x into a, voxel.y into b and voxel.z into c, you have that freedom as well.
    // const {x : a, y : b, z : c } = voxel; -> a = 3.6, b = 7.4, c = 6.45
    // You may read it as "get the field x and copy the value into a" and so on.
