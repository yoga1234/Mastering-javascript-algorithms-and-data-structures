    /*
    * ECMAScript is a standarized version of Javascript with the goal of unifying the language specifications and features.
    * As all major browsers and javascript-runtimes follow this specification,
    * the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term javascript.
    *
    * Javascript is an evolving programming language. As features are added and revisions are made,
    * new versions of the language are released for use by developers.
    *
    * The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015.
    * This new version of the language adds some powerful features that will be covered in this section.
    * Including: Arrow functions, Classes, Modules, Promises, Generators, let and const.
    *
    * Note:
    * Not all browsers support ES6 features. If you use ES6, you may need to use program (transpiler)-
    * to convert your ES6 code into ES5 untul browsers support ES6.
