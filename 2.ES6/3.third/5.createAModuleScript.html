    /*
    * Javascript started with a small role to play on an otherwise mostly HTML web.
    * Today, it's huge and some websites are almost built entirely with Javascript.
    * In order to make Javascript more modular, clean and maintainable;
    * ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JS files.
    * This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files
    * and importing the parts you need, where you need them.
    * In order to take advantage of this functionality,
    * you need to create a script in your HTML document with a type of [module].
    */

    // Example
    // <script type="module" src="filename.js"><scriptClose>

    /*
    * A script that uses this [module] type can now use the [import] and [export] features.
