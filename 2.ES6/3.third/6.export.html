    * Imagine a file called [math_functions.js], it contains several function -
    * related to mathematical operations.
    * One of them is stored in a variable, [add], that takes in two numbers and returns the sum of them.
    * You want to use this function in several different javascript files.
    * In order to share it with the files, you need to first [export] it.
    */

    // example
    export const add = (x, y) => {
      return x + y;
    }
    /*
    * The code above is a commin way to export a single function,
    * but you can achieve the same thing like code below
    */

      return x + y;
    }
    export {add2};

    /*
    * After you export a variable or function,
    * you can import it in another file to use without having to rewrite the code.
    * You can export multiple things by repeating the first example for each thing you want to export,
    * or by placing them all in the export statement of the second example like this:
    * export { add, subtract };
