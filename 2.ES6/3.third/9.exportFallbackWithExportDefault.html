    * In the [export], you learned about the syntax referred to as a named export.
    * This allowed you to make multiple functions and variables available for use in other files.
    *
    * There is another [export] syntax you need to know, known as [export default].
    * Usualy you will use this syntax if only one value is being exported from a file.
    * It is also used to create a fallback value for a file or module.

    // Below are examples using [export default]:
    // named function
    export default function add(x, y){
      return x + y;
    }

    // anonymous function
    export default function(a, b){
      return a + b;
    }

    /*
    * Since [export value] is used to declare a fallback value for a module or file,
    * you can only have one value be a default export in each module or file.
    * Additionally, you cannot use [export default] with [var, let, const].
