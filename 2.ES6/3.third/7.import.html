  /*
  * [import] allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load.
  * In the previous lesson, the examples exported [add] from the [math_functions.js] file.
  * Here how you can import it to use in another file:
  * import { add } from './math_functions.js';
  */

  /*
  * Here, [import] will find [add] in [math_functions.js], import just that function for you to use, and ignore the rest.
  * The [./] tells the import to look for the math_function.js file in the same folder as the current file.
  * The relative path [./] and the file extension[.js] are required when using import in this way.
  *
  * You can import more than one item from the file by adding them in the [import] statement like this.
  * import { add, subtract } from './math_function.js';
