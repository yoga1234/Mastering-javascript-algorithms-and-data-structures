    <title>Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function</title>

    /*
    * ES6 provides a new syntax to help create objects, using the keyword [class];
    *
    * This is to be noted, that the [class] syntax is just a syntax,
    * and not a full-fledged class based implementation of object oriented paradigm,
    * unlike in languages like Java, or Python, or Ruby etc.
    *
    * In ES5, we usually define a constructor function,
    * and use the [new] keyword to instantiate an object.
    */

    // Example:
    var spaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
      this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
    }
    var zeus = new spaceShuttle('Jupiter');

    // The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:
    class spaceShuttle2 {
      constructor(targetPlanet){
        this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
      }
    }
    const zeus2 = new spaceShuttle2('Jupiter');
    /*
    * Notice that the [class] keyword declares a new function and a constructor was added,
    * which would be invoked when [new] is called - to create new object.
    */

    /*
    * NOTES:
    * UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names,
    * as in [SpaceShuttle] used above.
    * The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object
    * with a class.
