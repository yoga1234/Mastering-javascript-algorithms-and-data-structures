    /*
    * When you declare a variable with the [var] keyword,
    * it is declared globally or locally if declared inside a function.
    *
    * The [let] keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features.
    * When you declare a variable with the [let] keyword inside a block, statement or expressions,
    * its scope is limited to that block, statement or expression.
    */

    // Example
    var numArray = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++){
      numArray.push(i);
    }
    console.log(numArray); // returns [0, 1, 2]
    console.log(i); // returns 3
    /*
    * With the [var] keyword, i is declared globally.
    * So when i++ is executed, it updates the global variable.
    */

    /*
    * This behaior will cause problems if you were to create a function-
    * and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the i variable.
    * This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global i variable.
    */

    // Second Example:
    var printNumTwo;
    for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      if(j === 2){
        printNumTwo = function() {
          return j;
        };
      }
    }
    console.log(printNumTwo());
    // returns 3
    /*
    * As you can see, printNumTwo() prints 3 and not 2.
    * Because the value assigned to [j] was updated and the printNumTwo() returns the global [j] and-
    * not the value [j] had when the function was created in the for loop.
    * The [let] keyword does not follow this behavior:
    */

    // Third Example
    'use strict';
    let printNumTwo;
    for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
      if (k === 2) {
        printNumTwo = function() {
          return k;
        };
      }
    }
    console.log(printNumTwo());
    // returns 2
    console.log(k);
    // returns "k is not defined"

    /*
    * [k] is not defined because it was not devlared in the global scope.
    * It is only declared within the for loop statement.
    * printNumTwo() returned the correct value because three different [k] variables with unique value-
    * (0, 1 and 2) were created by the [let] keyword within the loop statement.
