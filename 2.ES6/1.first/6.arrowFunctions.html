    <title>Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions</title>

  /*
  * In javascript, we often don't need to name our functions,
  * especially when passing a function as an argument to another function.
  * Instead, we create inline functions.
  * We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.
  */

  // First Example:
  const firstFunc = function(){
    const myVar = "value";
    return myVar;
  }

  /*
  * ES6 provides us with the syntatic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way.
  * Instead, you can use [arrow function syntax].
  */

  // Second example with arrow function:
  var secondFunc = () => {
    const myVar = "value";
    return myVar;
  }

  /*
  * When there is no function body and only return value,
  * arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword [return] as well as the brackets surrounding the code.
  * This helps simpifly smaller functions into one-line statements.
  */

  // Third example with one-line statements:
  const thirdFunc = () => "value";
  // The code above will still return ["value"] by default.
