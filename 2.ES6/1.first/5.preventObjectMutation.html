  /*
  * As seen in the mutate const array chapter,
  * [const] declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation.
  * To ensure your data doesn't change,
  * javascript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.
  *
  * Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update or delete properties from it.
  * Any attemp at changing the object will be rejected without an error.
  */

  // Example:
  let obj = {
    one: "This is string one",
    two: "This is string two"
  };
  Object.freeze(obj);
  obj.review = "This is string review"; // Will be ignored. Mutation not allowed.
  obj.newProp = "This is string newProp"; // will be ignored. Mutation not allowed.
  console.log(obj);
  // {one: "This is string one", two: "This is string two"}
