  /*
  * [let] is not the only new way to declare variables.
  * In ES6, you can also declare variables using the [const] keyword.
  *
  * [const] has all the awesome features that [let] has,
  * with the added bonus that variables declared using [conts] are read-only.
  * They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with [const], it cannot be reassigned.
  */

  // Example:
  "use strict"
  const FAV_PET = "Cats";
  FAV_PET = "Dogs";
  // Code above will returns error

  /*
  * As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with [const] will throw you an error.
  * You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the [const] keyword.
  * This helps when you accidentally attemp to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant.
  * A common practive when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, with words separated by an underscore.
