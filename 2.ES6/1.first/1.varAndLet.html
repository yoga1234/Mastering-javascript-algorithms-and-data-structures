    /*
    * One of the biggest problem with declaring variables with the [var] keyword is that you can-
    * overwrite variable declarations without an error.
    */

    var camper = 'James';
    var camper = 'David';
    console.log(camper);
    // logs 'David'

    /*
    * As you can see in the code above,
    * the [camper] variable is originally declared as [James] and then overridden to be [David].
    *
    * In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem,
    * but when your code becomes larger,
    * you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite.
    *
    * Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.
    *
    * A new keyword called [let] was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the [var] keyword.
    *
    * If you were to replace [var] with [let] in the variable declarations of the code before,
    * the result would be an error.
    * Error example:
    * -Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'camper' has already been declared...
    * This error can be seen in the console of your browser.
    *
    * So unlike [var], when using [let], a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
    *
    * Note the ["use strict"]. This enables Strict Mode,
    * which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe actions". For instance:
    *
    * "use strict"
    * x = 3.14 -> This will throw an error because x is not declared.

    // Another Example
    let catName;
    let quote;
    function catTalk(){
      "use strict";

      catName = "Oliver";
      quote = catName + " Says meow!";
    }
