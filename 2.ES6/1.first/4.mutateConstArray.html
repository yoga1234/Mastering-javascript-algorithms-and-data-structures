    /*
    * The [const] declaration has many use cases in modern Javascript.
    *
    * Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using [const] by default,
    * unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use [let].
    *
    * However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions)
    * assigned to a variable using [const] are still mutable.
    * Using the [const] declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.
    */

    // Example:
    "use strict";
    const s = [5, 6, 7];
    s = [1, 2, 3]; // This will throw an error, trying to assign a const
    s[2] = 45; // Works just as it would with an array declared with var or let.
    console.log(s); // returns [5, 6, 45]

    /*
    * As you can see, you can mutate the object [5, 6, 7] itself,
    * and the variable [s] will still point to the altered array [5, 6, 45].
    * Like all arrays, the array elements in [s] are mutable,
    * but because [const] was used, you cannot use the variable identifier [s] to point a different using the assignment operator.
