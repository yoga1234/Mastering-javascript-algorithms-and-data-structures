    /*
    * A promise in Javascript is exactly what it sounds like-
    * you use it to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously.
    * When the task completes, you either fulfill you promise or failt to do so.
    * [promise] is a constructor function, so you need to use a [new] keyword to create one.
    * It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject.
    * These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise.
    */

    // The syntax looks like this:
    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    });
