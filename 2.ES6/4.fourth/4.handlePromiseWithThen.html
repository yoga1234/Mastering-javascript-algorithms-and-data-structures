    /*
    * Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount -
    * of time in your code (i.e something asynchronous),
    * and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server.
    * This can be achieved by using the [then] method.
    * The [then] method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with [resolved].
    */

    // Example
    myPromise.then(result => {
      // do something with the result.
    });

    /*
    * [result] comes from the argument given to the [resolve] method.
    */

    // Second example
    const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
      let responseFromServer = true;

      if(responseFromServer){
        resolve("We got the data");
      } else {
        reject("Data not received");
      }
    });

    makeServerRequest.then(result => {
      console.log(result);
    });
