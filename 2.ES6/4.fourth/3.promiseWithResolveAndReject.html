    * A promise has three states: [pending, fulfilled, and rejected].
    * The promise you created in the last challenge is forever stuck in the [pending] state
    * because you did not add a way to complete the promise.
    * The [resolve] and [reject] parameters given to the promise argument are used to do this.
    * [resolve] is used when you want your promise to succeed.
    * [reject] is used when you want it to fail.
    * These are methods that take an argument, as seen below.

    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    * The example above uses strings for the argument of these functions,
    * but it can really be anything.
    * Often, it might be an object, that you would data from,
    * to put on your website or elsewhere.
