    * In the casino game Blackjack,
    * a player can gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck.
    * This is called Card Counting.
    */

    /*
    * Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player.
    * Each card is assigned a value according to the table below.
    * When the count is positive, the player should bet high.
    * When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.
    */

    * Count Change - Cards
    * +1 - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    * 0 - 7, 8, 9
    * -1 - 10, J, Q, K, A
    */

    /*
    * Write a card counting function.
    * It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string,
    * and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value.
    * The function will then return a string with the current count and the string bet if the count is positive,
    * or Hold if the count is zero or negative.
    * The current count and the player's decision(Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

    * Example output.
    * -3 Hold
    * 5 bet

    * hint
    * Do not reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8 or 9.
    * Do nit return an array.
    * Do not include quotes (single or double) in the output.
