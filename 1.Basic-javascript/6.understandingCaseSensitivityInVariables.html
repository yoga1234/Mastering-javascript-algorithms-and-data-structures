    * In javascript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
    * myvar is not the same as myVar or MyVar.
    * it is possible to have multiple distict variables with the same name but different casing.
    */

    /*
    * Best practice
    * Write variable name in javascript in camelCase,
    * multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase
    * and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
