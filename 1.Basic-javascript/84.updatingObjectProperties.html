    var ourDog = {
      "name": "Camper",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["everything"]

    * Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper".
    * Here's how we update his object's name property:
    * ourdog.name = "Happy Camper";
    * or
    * ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";
    * now when we evaluate ourDog.name,
    * instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".
