      * In javascript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called concatenation operator.
      * You can build a new string out of other string by concatenating them together.
      * 'My name is ' + 'Yogasmara.'
      */

      /*
      * Watch out for spaces.
      * Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you will need to add them yourself.
