    /*
    * If there are many options to choose from, use a switch statement.
    * A Switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values.
    *  Statements are executed from the first match case value until a break is encountered.
    */

    /*
    Pseudocode example:
    switch(num) {
      case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
      case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    ...
      case valueN:
        statementN;
        break;
    }
    */

    /*
    * Case values are tested with strict equality (===).
    * The break tells javascript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.
