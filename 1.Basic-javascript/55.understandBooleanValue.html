    * Another data type is the Boolean.
    * Boolean may only be one of two values: true or false.
    * They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off".
    * These two states are mutually exclusive.
    */

    /*
    * Boolean values are nver written with quotes.
    * The strings "true" and "false" are not boolean and have no special meaning in javascript.
