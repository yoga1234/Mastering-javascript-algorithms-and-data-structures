    /*
    * Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string.
    * There are two reasons to use escaping characters:
    * -First is to allow you to use characters you might not otherwise be able to hype out, such as backspace.
    * -Second is to allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without javascript misinterpreting what you mean.
    */

    /*
    * Another escape characters :
    * \' Single quote
    * \" Double quote
    * \\ backslash
    * \n newline
    * \r carriage return
    * \t tab
    * \b backspace
    * \f form feed
    *
    *Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash
