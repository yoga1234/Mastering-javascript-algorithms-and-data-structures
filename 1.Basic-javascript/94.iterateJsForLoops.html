    /*
    * The common type of javascript loop is called a "for loop",
    * because it runs "for" a specified number of times.
    *
    * For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:
    * for([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])
    *
    * The [initialization] statement is executed one time onlye before the loop starts.
    * It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.
    *
    * The [condition] statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration
    * and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When [condition] is false at the start of iteration,
    * the loop will stop executing.
    * This means if [condition] starts as false, your loop will never execute.
    *
    * The [final-expression] is executed at the end of each loop iteration,
    * prior to the next [condition] check and is usually used to increment or decrement loop counter.
    */

    /*
    * In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true.
    * We will increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our [final-expression].
    */
    var ourArray = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
      ourArray.push(i);
    }
    // Now ourArray will contain [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
