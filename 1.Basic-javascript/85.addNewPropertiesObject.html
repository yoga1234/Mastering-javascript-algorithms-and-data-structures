    * You can add new properties to existing javascript objects the same way you would modify them.
    * Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:
    * ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
    * or
    * ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
    * Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".
    */

    // Example
    var ourDog = {
      "name": "Camper",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "friends": ["Everything"]
    };

    ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
