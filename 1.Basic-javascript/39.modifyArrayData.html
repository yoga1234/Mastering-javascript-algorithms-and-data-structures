  //Example
  var myArray = [10, 20, 30];
  myArray[0] = 9; // Now myArray have value [9, 20, 30]

  /*
  * There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets.
  * Although javascript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers that reading your code.
