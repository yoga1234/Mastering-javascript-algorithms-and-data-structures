    /*
    * The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true.
    * Otherwise, it returns false.
    *
    * The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols (|).
    * This can typically be found between your backspace and enter keys.
    */

    /*
    * The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:
    * if (num > 10) {
    *  return "No";
    * }
    * if (num < 5) {
    *  return "No";
    * }
    * return "Yes";
    */

    /*
    * Will return "Yes" only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included).
    * The same logic can be written as:
    * if(num > 10 || num < 5){
    *  return "No";
    * }
    * return "Yes";
