      * We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.
      *
      * Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that string use, except that instead of specifying a character,
      * they are specifying an entry in the array.
      * Like strings, array use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array is element 0.
      */

      // Example
      var array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      array[0]; // is equal 1
      var data = array[1]; // is equal 2

      /*
      * There shouln't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets,
      * like array [0].
      * Although javascript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.
