      * The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
      * 5 % 2 = 1 because
      * Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
      * 2 * 2 = 4
      * 5 - 4 = 1(Remainder)

      /*
      * Usage
      * In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.
      * 11 % 2 = 1 (11 is odd)
      * 12 % 2 = 0 (12 is odd)
      */

      var example = 11 % 2;
      var exampleTwo = 12 % 2;

      /*
      * The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator.
      * It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with the negative numbers.
