    * There are two ways to access the properties of an object:
    * Dot notation (.) and bracket notation([]), similar to an array.
    *
    * Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you are trying to access ahead of time.

    // Example of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:
    var myObj = {
      prop1: "value 1",
      prop2: "value 2"
    };
    var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // value 1
    var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // value 2
