    * If the break statement is ommited from a switch statement's case,
    * the following case statements are executed until a break is encountered.
    * If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:
      switch (val) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:

        case 4:
          result = "4 alone";
      }
    * Cases for 1, 2 and 3 will all produce the same result.
