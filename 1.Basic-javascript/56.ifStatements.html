  /*
  * If statements are used to make decisions in code.
  * The keyword "if" tells Javascript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions,
  * defined in the parentheses.
  * These conditions are known as Boolean condition and they may only be true or false.
  */

  /*
  * When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces.
  * When the boolean condition evaluates to false, the statemen inside the curly braces will not exeutes.
  */

  /*
  * Pseudocode
  * if(condition is true){
  *  statement is executed
  * }
  */

  // Example
  function exampleFunc(myCondition){
    if(myCondition){
      return "It was true";
    }
    return "It was false";
  }
  console.log(exampleFunc(true)); // returns "It was true"
  console.log(exampleFunc(false)); // returns "It was false"

  /*
  * When exampleFunc is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not.
  * Since it is true, the function returns "It was true".
  * When we call test with a value of false, my condition is not true and the function returns "It was false".
