    /*
    * It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers,
    * but it's even more usefu; if we use it to generate random whole numbers.
    * 1. Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
    * 2. Multiply that randm decimal by 20.
    * 3. Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
    *
    * Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and,
    * because we're rounding down it is impossible to actually get 20.
    * This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.
    */

    // Example code
    console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 20));
    /*
    * We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20,
    * then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.
