    * In javascript, scope refers to the visibility of variables.
    * Variables which are defined outside of a function block have global scope.
    * This means, they can be seen everywhere in your javascript code.
    *
    * Variablels which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.
    * This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again.
    * Best practices is always declare your variables with var.
