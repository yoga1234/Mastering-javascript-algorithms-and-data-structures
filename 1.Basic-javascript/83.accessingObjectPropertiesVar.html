    /*
    * Another use of bracket notation on object is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.
    * This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
    */

    // Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:
    var dogs = {
      Fido: "Mutt",
      Hunter: "Doberman",
      Snoopie: "Beagle"
    };
    var myDog = "Hunter";
    var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
    console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
    // Code above is property stored as the value of the variable

    /*
    * Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution.
    * as follows:
    */

    var someObj = {
      propName: "John"
    };
    function propPrefix(str){
      var s = "prop";
      return s + str;
    }
    var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
    console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"

    /*
    * Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property
    * because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.
