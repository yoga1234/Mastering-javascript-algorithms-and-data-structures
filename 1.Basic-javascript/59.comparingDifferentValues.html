    * If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion,
    * and then evaluate the values.
    * However, the strict equality operator will perform compare both the data type and value as-is,
    * without converting one type to the other.

    /*
    * Example
    * 3 == '3' -> returns true because JS performs type conversion from string to number
    * 3 === '3' -> returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed
    */

    /*
    * in javascript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator,
    * as follows:
    * typeof 3 -> returns 'number'
    * typeof '3' -> returns 'string'
