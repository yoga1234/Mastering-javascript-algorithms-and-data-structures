    /*
    * The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket ([]).
    * If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
    *
    * However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.
    */

    // Example
    var objTest = {
      "Object One": "This is object one",
      "Object Two": "This is object two",
      "objectThree": "This is object three"
    };
    objTest["Object One"]; // This is object One
    objTest['Object Two']; // This is object Two
    objTest["objectThree"]; // This is object three

    // Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).
