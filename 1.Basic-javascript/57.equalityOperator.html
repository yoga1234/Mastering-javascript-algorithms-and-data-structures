    /*
    * There are many comparison operator in javascript.
    * All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.
    *
    * The most basic operator is the equality operator == .
    * The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not.
    * Note that equality is different from assignment (=),
    * which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left.
    */

    // example
    function equalityTest(myVal){
      if(myVal == 10){
        return "Equal";
      }
      return "Not equal";
    }

    /*
    * If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true.
    * so the code in the curly braces will execute and the function will return "equal".
    * Otherwise, the function will return "Not equal".
    */

    /*
    * In order for javascript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings),
    * it must convert one type to another.
    * This is known as "Type coercion". Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:
    * 1 == 1 -> true
    * 1 == 2 -> false
    * 1 == '1' -> true
    * "3" == 3 ->true
