      * Object are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data,
      * you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
      *
      * Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way,
      * and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

      // Example of cat object:
      var cat = {
        "name": "Whiskers",
        "legs": 4,
        "tails": 1,
        "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
      };

      /*
      * In the example above, all the properties are stored as strings,
      * such as: "name", "legs" and "tails".
      * However, you can also use numbers as properties.
      * You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as example below:
      */

      var anotherObject = {
        make: "Ford",
        5: "Five",
        "model": "focus"
      };

      /*
      * However, if your object has non-string properties, javascript will automatically typecast them as strings.
      */

      // Example of dog object:
      var myDog = {
        "name": "Doggy",
        "legs": 4,
        "tails": 1,
        "friends": ["cat", "water", "ball"]
