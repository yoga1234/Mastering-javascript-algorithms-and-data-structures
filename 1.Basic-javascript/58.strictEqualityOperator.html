    /*
    * strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==).
    * however, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type,
    * the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.
    *
    * if the values being compared have different types,
    * the are considered unequal,
    * and the strict equality operator will return false.
    *
    * 3 === 3 // true
    * 3 === '3' // false
    * in the second example, 3 is a number type and '3' is a string type.
