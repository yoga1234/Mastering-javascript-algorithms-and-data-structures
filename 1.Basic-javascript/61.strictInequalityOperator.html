    * The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator.
    * It means "Strictly not equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa.
    * Strict inequality will not convert data types.
    */

    /*
    * Example
    * 3 !== 3 -> false
    * 3 !== '3' -> true
    * 4 !== 3 -> true
