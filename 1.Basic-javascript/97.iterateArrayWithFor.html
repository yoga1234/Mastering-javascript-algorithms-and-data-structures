    * A common task in javascript is to iterate through the contents of an array.
    * One way to do that is with a for loop.
    * This code will output each element of the array arr to the console.

    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){

    /*
    * Remember that arrays have zero-based numbering, which means the last index of the array is length - 1.
    * Out condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops when i is at length - 1.
