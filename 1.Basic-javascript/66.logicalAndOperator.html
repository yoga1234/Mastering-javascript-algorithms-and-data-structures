    /*
    * Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time.
    * The logical and Operator(&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.
    *
    * The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:
    * if (num > 5) {
    *  if (num >  10) {
    *   return "Yes";
    *  }
    * }
    * return "No";
    *
    * Will only return "Yes" if num is greater than 5 and less than 10.
    * The same logic can be written as:
    * if(num > 5 && num < 10){
    *  return "Yes";
    * }
    * return "No";
