    /*
    * The next type of loop is called a "do...while" loop because it first will "do" one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what,
    * and then it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.
    */

    // Example
    var ourArray = [];
    var i = 0;
    do {
      ourArray.push(i);
      i++;
    } while (i < 5);

    /*
    * This behave just as any ohter type of loop,
    * and the resulting array would like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
    * However, what makes the do...while different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check.
    * Essentially, a do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once.
