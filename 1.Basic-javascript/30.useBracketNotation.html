    /*
    * Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.
    */

    /*
    * Most modem programming languages, like javascript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. THis is referred to as Zero-based indexing.
    */

    /*
    * For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C".
    * so if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].
    */

    var name = "Yogasmara";
    console.log(name[0]);
