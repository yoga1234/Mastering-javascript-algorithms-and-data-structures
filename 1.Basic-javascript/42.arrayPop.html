      * Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.
      *
      * .pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array.
      * We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words,
      * .pop() remove the last element from an array and returns that element.
      *
      * Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

      var arrayPop = exampleArray.pop(); // Now arrayPop = 5 and remove 5 from exampleArray
